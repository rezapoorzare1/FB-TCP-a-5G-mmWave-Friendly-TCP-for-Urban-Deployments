This repository contains the codes for the FB-TCP protocol from the following paper:

“FB-TCP: a 5G mmWave Friendly TCP for Urban Deployments.”, which can be found in "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9448054".

The repository contains .cc, .h, and scenarios' files.

The principal purpose of the protocol is to overcome the flaws that the transport layer of the protocol stack encounter when deployed in 5G mmWave networks. This protocol is based on Fuzzy logic, which strives to prevent performance reduction in the urban deployment and achieve the possible saturated value. Moreover, it tries to reach its goal through low latency and keep the average sending rate as small as possible to restrain the buffer exhaustion. The extensive conducted simulations showed that this protocol outperforms the conventional TCPs in terms of throughput, RTT, and sending rate adjustment.
FB-TCP can be exploited as one of the appropriate transport layer protocols in 5G mmWave networks, especially in urban deployments.
